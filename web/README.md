<h1>Trybetunes</h1>

<p>
    Trybetunes is an application capable of playing music from the most varied bands and artists, creating a list of favorite songs and editing the 
    profile of the logged in user. This project was developed with the purpose of exercising the creation of class components in React. The application
    can be refactored using context API and react Hooks or Redux, it will making the code cleaner and more readable, in addition to avoiding prop      
    drilling. 
</p>

<p>
  For now this application has not been styled. I intend to refactor the code using a state manager and then style the application.
